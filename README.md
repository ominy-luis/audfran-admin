# Audfran-Admin

A project in which I helped a friend do an academic project for a real company, with the aim of managing the company's internal sectors. The well-known management system.

I took part in creating the structural basis of the project, then passed on the rest for him to complete according to the client's needs.

Used technologies:

- ReactJs (18.2.0)
- NodeJs (18.17.1)
- Axios (0.18.0)
- CSS
